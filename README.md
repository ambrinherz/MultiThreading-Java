# MultiThreading-Java
Multithreading in Java is explained using Java ExecutorService and Callable Interface. 
I used Callable interface because it's easy to catch checked(compile time) exceptions and it also returns a value. 
But if you don't care about checked exceptions or returing a value, Runnable interface could be used.
